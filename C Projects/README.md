Computer Engineering 

Hello I'm George, I'm studying Computer Engineering in UPatras since 2024, I wanted to keep a backup or archive of my projects. Some projects are completely mine (meaning I did whatever I wanted) and some were instructed so I did what my teachers wanted :(  So if some of part of the Code seems stupid might be because the teachers wanted it that way (or I am just trash at programming). Everyone is free to copy and reuse my code it is pretty beginner anyway.
